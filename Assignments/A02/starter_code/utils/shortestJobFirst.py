    Shortest Job First scheduler that extends base Scheduler.
    Inserts Each process inserted into the ready queue will be
    placed in the correct order. This way the cpu won't have to
    search for the shortest job. It will always be the first one.
    
    To implement this, I overwrote the 'add_process' and 'step'
    member function inherited from base scheduler (FCFS).
