Left to do:
    1. Schedulers ✅
        -SRTF
        -Priority
    2. Simulation ✅
        - Will need to create script that will run a bunch of different simulations
        - with different parameters on different files, and output/display info
        - needed for calculations.
        - For every change made to the parameters, run every scheduler on it?
    3. Analyze Results (Avg wait, Turnaround time, etc)
    5. Discussion Questions
        - Why is it valuable to separate the scheduler logic from the visualization layer?
        - How could this design be extended to run two schedulers at once (for comparison)?
        - What information should the visualizer not have access to, and why?
