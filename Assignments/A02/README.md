## Overview
This project simulates CPU and I/O scheduling to analyze how different scheduling algorithms perform under various workloads. The simulation generates random processes and evaluates them using multiple schedulers such as:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**

After running simulations, the program outputs results to compare metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and throughput to determine which scheduler performs best under specific conditions.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to model how operating systems manage CPU and I/O scheduling and to visualize how different algorithms handle process queues. The findings can be used to better understand the trade-offs in scheduling strategies.
