## Overview
This project simulates CPU and I/O scheduling to analyze how different scheduling algorithms perform under various workloads. The simulation generates random processes and evaluates them using multiple schedulers such as:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**

After running simulations, the program outputs results to compare metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and throughput to determine which scheduler performs best under specific conditions.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to model how operating systems manage CPU and I/O scheduling and to visualize how different algorithms handle process queues. The findings can be used to better understand the trade-offs in scheduling strategies.

## Discussion Question
### Why It’s Valuable to Separate the Scheduler Logic from the Visualization Layer

Separating the scheduler logic from the visualization layer makes the project easier to manage and understand. The scheduler handles all the core processing and decisions for algorithms like FCFS, SJF, or Round Robin, while the visualization focuses only on displaying the results, such as the Gantt chart or process timeline. Keeping these parts separate allows changes to one without affecting the other. It also makes testing and debugging simpler, since we can verify the scheduler’s calculations independently from the visuals. This structure improves flexibility, allows code reuse for different interfaces, and supports future updates or new algorithms. Overall, it helps maintain a cleaner and more modular project design that follows good programming principles.
